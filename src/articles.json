      ["p", "When I was 12 years old, I loved playing video games. It was my favorite hobby, and I spent countless hours in front of the computer testing new game releases and chatting with gaming communities. While I knew programming existed, learning to code never crossed my mind."],
      ["p", "My introduction to the world of coding was quite interesting. One day, while watching YouTube videos about the famous game \"Geometry Dash,\" I stumbled upon a tutorial for Cocos2D, the program used to develop the game. I clicked out of curiosity, unaware that I was stepping into the world that would shape my future."],
      ["p", "The program seemed quite complex, and my 12-year-old self didn't understand anything. However, in the comments of the video, a wonderful person (whom I am grateful for) appeared and explained that a simpler tool called \"Game Maker\" existed."],
      ["p", "Driven by curiosity, I searched for \"Game Maker\" on YouTube and watched the first tutorial that appeared in Spanish. That's when my journey began."],
      ["galery", ["testimg1.jpg"]],
      ["p", "The program had a Drag and Drop system similar to Scratch, making it much easier for my 12-year-old self to learn."],
      ["p", "When I created my first games and showed them to my friends, they were amazed. Obviously, they weren't anything extraordinary, but we were young and easily impressed by anything wonderful."],
      ["p", "In addition to Drag and Drop, the program came with its own language called GML, which allowed you to create more complex and professional games. So, when I turned 13, I made a decision to put effort into learning it."],
      ["p", "And there I was! A 13-year-old boy learning if statements, for loops, arrays, and algorithms. Obviously, my code was horrible. I didn't even know that a switch statement existed, so I created infinite if chains. But my code worked! And I was so proud of it."],
      ["subtitle", "Jumping World:"],
      ["p", "At that age, I met another young boy who was also coding with GM. We decided to collaborate on a project called \"Jumping World\" (which I decided to remaster in 2024, but that's for another post!)"],
      ["p", "That was the best experience I've ever had on my coding journey. My friend was gifted. He started coding when he was 8, and he had knowledge on how to write clean and effective code. So, when he saw my code... well, let's just say he screamed in horror."],
      ["p", "He taught me every clean code technique: the switch statements, how to manipulate arrays correctly, how to manage external files, etc. Most of the things I know about programming now are thanks to the Jumping World experience."],
      ["subtitle", "The dark phase of my life:"],
      ["p", "2021 was the worst year of my life (I have a post specifically for this, it should appear in the aside so you can take a look). I spent 2021 - 2023 without using Game Maker. Then, by July of 2023, when I was mentally okay, I decided to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That was the best decision I've ever made because all the GameMaker experience helped me learn JavaScript very quickly. The only new things were array methods, functions, and DOM manipulation."],
      ["p", "And here we are! In 2024, at 17 years old, I'm learning TypeScript, React, and then I'll move on to backend and Python. Such an interesting journey, full of game development."],

Then, when I started high school, things worsened. The only thing I was doing with my life was playing video games and watching videos on my computer. Nothing productive."],

      ["p", "When my second year of high school started, I didnâ€™t have any friends because I changed schools after primary graduation. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the school year was divided into 'bubbles' of students, with some weeks being in-person and others virtual."],
      ["p", "The few people I talked to in 2020 weren't in my bubble, so I had to make new friends because there weren't many options. It was difficult to interact with kids from other groups due to the pandemic restrictions, and even talking with my own classmates was challenging."],
      ["p", "Unfortunately, I ended up in a group of aimless, misogynistic, and foolish boys. Since I was the best student in my class, they used to ask me for homework because, according to them, it was a form of 'friendship'."],
      ["p", "They manipulated me in a lot of ways. I won't go into detail about all the situations because I don't want to relive that year. In addition to the tough high school experience, my family noticed that I was becoming weaker and neglecting my physical appearance, causing them to lose their respect for me."],
      ["p", "And what did I do during my days? The same as the previous year: playing video games, listening to music, and doing absolutely nothing productive. I couldn't comprehend that all my suffering was due to my lifestyle, not just unlucky circumstances."],
      ["p", "By the end of the year, I was alone, weak, without family support, and no one was there to save me. November 2021 was the closest I had ever been to my breaking point, but then in December... things changed."],
      [],
      ["p", "While watching YouTube videos, I stumbled upon a specific and intriguing topic called 'self-improvement'. My family had always dismissed such content as stupid (yet ironically, they had never actually watched any of it). Initially, I rejected the idea, but my self-loathing was so intense that I forced myself to give it a chance."],
      ["p", "In those videos, I encountered some of the toughest lessons I had ever heard in December 2021: YOU are the only one responsible for your suffering, if people mistreat you, it's because they don't respect you, if you constantly complain, things won't change, pain equals change, and so on."],
      ["p", "It was then that I realized I had control over my life, and although it seemed impossible, I could change it."],

      ["p", "January 1st, I said: \"This is going to be my best year\" (Spoiler: it wasn't, but...)"],
      ["p", "I began applying those principles, and my life started changing drastically. It was tough for a 15-year-old boy to come to terms with his perceived ugliness, and even tougher when people mocked his efforts to change. But what mattered most was that I never gave up."],
      ["p", "One of the most significant events of the year occurred in August-September when I experienced my first existential crisis. I questioned my daily struggle for improvement: What's the point? Why continue living and working when I'm just an insignificant person? Despite this crisis, I refused to give up. Instead, I delved into life philosophy, contemplating these existential questions, essential for future growth."],
      ["p", "It was a year filled with suffering, discipline, false friendships, shame, and self-hatred. I didn't start seeing results until the final months of the year, but what transpired next was nothing short of incredible to me."],
      ["subtitle", "2023:"],
      ["p", "Not the best year of my life, but it was the one in which I made the most progress. I discovered the benefits of regular exercise, learned how to cultivate genuine friendships, took up volleyball, and expanded my social circle. It was also the year I began learning web development and created my Twitter account."],
      ["p", "Most importantly: I found my personal style. Embracing messy hair and sports clothes made me feel more confident and attractive."],

      ["p", "Was 2021 really three years ago? It felt like a decade, but what sticks with me is the transformation I've undergone. Self-improvement and challenges are my new lifestyle. This journey has made me incredibly confident. Those who once laughed at me in class now find themselves uneasy in my presence. Being the most confident person in a group is an indescribable feeling of triumph."],
      ["p", "I share my story not out of egocentrism but because I believe that anyone willing to endure the pain of change can create a remarkable life. My life stands as a testament to that truth."],
      ["p", "Am I satisfied with where I am now? I'll be honest: I'm grateful for the progress I've made, but I haven't yet reached my ultimate destination. I have countless plans and aspirations that drive me each morning, imagining the bright future that awaits me."],
      ["p", "I hope you, too, find your purpose and motivation to face each day with enthusiasm. Remember, if life treats you poorly, it's up to YOU to initiate change. While circumstances play a role, it's your determination and hard work that ultimately propel you forward. Without them, you'll remain stagnant."]
