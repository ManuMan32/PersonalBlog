      ["p", "When I was 12 years old, I loved playing video games. It was my favorite hobby, and I spent countless hours in front of the computer testing new game releases and chatting with gaming communities. While I knew programming existed, learning to code never crossed my mind."],
      ["p", "My introduction to the world of coding was quite interesting. One day, while watching YouTube videos about the famous game \"Geometry Dash,\" I stumbled upon a tutorial for Cocos2D, the program used to develop the game. I clicked out of curiosity, unaware that I was stepping into the world that would shape my future."],
      ["p", "The program seemed quite complex, and my 12-year-old self didn't understand anything. However, in the comments of the video, a wonderful person (whom I am grateful for) appeared and explained that a simpler tool called \"Game Maker\" existed."],
      ["p", "Driven by curiosity, I searched for \"Game Maker\" on YouTube and watched the first tutorial that appeared in Spanish. That's when my journey began."],
      ["galery", ["testimg1.jpg"]],
      ["p", "The program had a Drag and Drop system similar to Scratch, making it much easier for my 12-year-old self to learn."],
      ["p", "When I created my first games and showed them to my friends, they were amazed. Obviously, they weren't anything extraordinary, but we were young and easily impressed by anything wonderful."],
      ["p", "In addition to Drag and Drop, the program came with its own language called GML, which allowed you to create more complex and professional games. So, when I turned 13, I made a decision to put effort into learning it."],
      ["p", "And there I was! A 13-year-old boy learning if statements, for loops, arrays, and algorithms. Obviously, my code was horrible. I didn't even know that a switch statement existed, so I created infinite if chains. But my code worked! And I was so proud of it."],
      ["subtitle", "Jumping World:"],
      ["p", "At that age, I met another young boy who was also coding with GM. We decided to collaborate on a project called \"Jumping World\" (which I decided to remaster in 2024, but that's for another post!)"],
      ["p", "That was the best experience I've ever had on my coding journey. My friend was gifted. He started coding when he was 8, and he had knowledge on how to write clean and effective code. So, when he saw my code... well, let's just say he screamed in horror."],
      ["p", "He taught me every clean code technique: the switch statements, how to manipulate arrays correctly, how to manage external files, etc. Most of the things I know about programming now are thanks to the Jumping World experience."],
      ["subtitle", "The dark phase of my life:"],
      ["p", "2021 was the worst year of my life (I have a post specifically for this, it should appear in the aside so you can take a look). I spent 2021 - 2023 without using Game Maker. Then, by July of 2023, when I was mentally okay, I decided to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That was the best decision I've ever made because all the GameMaker experience helped me learn JavaScript very quickly. The only new things were array methods, functions, and DOM manipulation."],
      ["p", "And here we are! In 2024, at 17 years old, I'm learning TypeScript, React, and then I'll move on to backend and Python. Such an interesting journey, full of game development."],

      ["p", "I didn't install Instagram until I was 15. You might think that maybe that's a very good thing, but the truth is, it's not. Nowadays, your Instagram account is like your letter of introduction to new young people. Not having one is like being completely invisible."],
      ["p", "You're reading this and you're probably thinking: <i>What?</i>"],
      ["p", "Let me explain. Depending on your age or location, this may sound strange, but there are people who, when they see someone attractive on the street, the first thing they do is ask for their Instagram. Do you understand the point?"],
      ["p", "I want to start by talking about this app, which is the one I have the most experience with, to be able to show you how it can be a tool instead of a waste of time."],
      ["p", "Since I made my account in 2022 and worried about having a good profile, I've met and talked to new people, learned a lot of things from others, and understood many current concepts. Does Instagram somehow improve your social skills as a young person? Yes, it does. As much as it may be hard to admit, this social media platform is the only one that helps you establish a good image in front of other young people."],
      ["p", "BUT READ THIS PARAGRAPH, BEFORE MY MESSAGE IS MISINTERPRETED! I'm not saying that people who don't have Instagram or aren't active on the platform are considered friendless social failures. Each person is different and having Instagram does not make you better or worse. I'm only commenting on the meaning that young people give it. If you want to be someone who works in the shadows and doesn't want to be distracted by social things, it seems completely acceptable to me that you don't want to install this app, I'm not at all recommending that you be the same as others."],
      ["p", "That's why I want you to read this complex and stupid world that is Instagram, in which today's young people are immersed."],

      ["subtitle", "Behaviours on Instagram:"],
      ["p", "The normal thing is that you upload to your Instagram story if you have done something interesting that day, and here a curious behavior comes into play: the likes on the stories. If you upload a photo at the gym showing your muscles, and a guy likes it, what does it mean? Does he think you have very good results? Does he like the photo? Does he like you? You will never know. You will have to deduce it depending on who the person is."],
      ["p", "When you are interested in someone, the most 'normal' thing to do to get their attention and give them signs is to start following them on Instagram and occasionally like their stories. In fact, it is not uncommon for strangers to message you on your Instagram account, so I have met many people who are my friends today. This way, if you like someone, you can simply talk to them through this app and see if they engage in the conversation."],
      ["p", "But of course, just because someone talks to you or likes your stories doesn't mean they like you. That's the problem with Instagram; you never know what people's intentions are."],
      ["p", "This leads to a current problem for young people: they are very paranoid when it comes to social media. They give too much importance to who sees their stories, who likes them, who talks to them, who views their account, who liked X reel, etc. I personally have already been through this, and I can say that letting yourself be manipulated by these stimuli is the most depressing feeling that exists."],
      ["p", "I still have Instagram, but I use it very occasionally. As I said before, the idea is to know how to use it well. The only two things I do in this app are: polish my profile to have a good image and watch reels and stories from certain people who I think create good content."],
      ["p", "But it's too much Instagram for now. Let's talk about other social medias:"],
      ["subtitle", "Twitter / X"],
      ["p", "There aren't too many things to talk about this platform. Not many young people use it to create content. They typically post hints of love and retweet posts with which they feel identified. From time to time it gets interesting when there are fights within the posts. That's another use they give to social media: fighting and criticizing each other, and Twitter is usually the most common place where these things happen."],
      ["subtitle", "TikTok"],
      ["p", "Probably the most used among young people, but I can't say much since I never used it. I only installed it once, and it was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life."],
      ["p", "Studying the behavior of young people on this app would be enough for another entire article..."],
      ["subtitle", "WhatsApp"],
      ["p", "There are two types of young people: The mysterious ones who have their last seen and online status deactivated, in addition to having the option to delete messages that have been in the chat history for a long time. And then there are those who don't change any settings, the 'paranoid' ones who look at the last time someone logged in and draw conclusions from it."],
      ["p", "------"],
      ["p", "In conclusion, social networks are a medium that defines the behavior and image of young people today. If you are older, you may not fully understand the reason for this, but as a 17-year-old boy who lives in the digital generation, the experiences are very real, and many times parents are not present in their children's lives to explain what is wrong and what is right to do on the Internet."]

Then, when I started high school, things worsened. The only thing I was doing with my life was playing video games and watching videos on my computer. Nothing productive."],

      ["p", "The few people I talked to in 2020 weren't in my bubble, so I had to make new friends because there weren't many options. It was difficult to interact with kids from other groups due to the pandemic restrictions, and even talking with my own classmates was challenging."],
      ["p", "Unfortunately, I ended up in a group of aimless, misogynistic, and foolish boys. Since I was the best student in my class, they used to ask me for homework because, according to them, it was a form of 'friendship'."],
      ["p", "They manipulated me in a lot of ways. I won't go into detail about all the situations because I don't want to relive that year. In addition to the tough high school experience, my family noticed that I was becoming weaker and neglecting my physical appearance, causing them to lose their respect for me."],

      ["p", "While watching YouTube videos, I stumbled upon a specific and intriguing topic called 'self-improvement'. My family had always dismissed such content as stupid (yet ironically, they had never actually watched any of it). Initially, I rejected the idea, but my self-loathing was so intense that I forced myself to give it a chance."],
      ["p", "In those videos, I encountered some of the toughest lessons I had ever heard in December 2021: YOU are the only one responsible for your suffering, if people mistreat you, it's because they don't respect you, if you constantly complain, things won't change, pain equals change, and so on."],

      ["p", "One of the most significant events of the year occurred in August-September when I experienced my first existential crisis. I questioned my daily struggle for improvement: What's the point? Why continue living and working when I'm just an insignificant person? Despite this crisis, I refused to give up. Instead, I delved into life philosophy, contemplating these existential questions, essential for future growth."],
      ["p", "It was a year filled with suffering, discipline, false friendships, shame, and self-hatred. I didn't start seeing results until the final months of the year, but what transpired next was nothing short of incredible to me."],
      ["subtitle", "2023:"],
      ["p", "Not the best year of my life, but it was the one in which I made the most progress. I discovered the benefits of regular exercise, learned how to cultivate genuine friendships, took up volleyball, and expanded my social circle. It was also the year I began learning web development and created my Twitter account."],

This journey has made me incredibly confident. Those who once laughed at me in class now find themselves uneasy in my presence. Being the most confident person in a group is an indescribable feeling of triumph."],
